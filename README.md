# Heliophysics Events

This repository is for a college assignment where my group had to create a computer vision model.
Honestly, the model itself isn't that great, but I had so much fun working on this project that I just had to make a separate repo for it. 
This project is so special to me because it combines two of my passions: technology and scientific stuff. I hope to do it more times in the future.

## Roboflow

The dataset for this project can be found on [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/blackout-lazqw/heliophysics-events). It contains four different target classes: solar flare, coronal hole, sigmoid, and active region.
